Project Name – Netflix EDA and AI Movie Recommendation Model
Objective :
Prepare and analyze the Netflix Titles dataset using methods learnt and researched independently. The tasks include Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, and building a Content-Based Recommendation System.
Identify and report patterns observed in the dataset through descriptive statistics and visualizations.
Tasks Performed :
- Cleaned the data (missing values handled for cast, director, country, listed_in, etc.)
- Created new numerical features from date and duration fields
- Performed EDA using graphs and visualizations
- Observed distributions across genres, ratings, actors, countries, and release years
- Built a TF-IDF based Content Similarity model
- Evaluated results using similarity ranking of movie/series titles
Tools / Technologies Used :
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)
Key Results :
- Clear insights into Netflix content trends
- Successfully engineered numerical features for better analysis
- Developed a functional content-based recommendation engine
- Generated meaningful visualizations such as heatmaps, PCA plots, KNN distance curves, actor frequency charts, genre analysis, etc.
